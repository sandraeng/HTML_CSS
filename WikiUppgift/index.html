  <h1>Yellow-faced honeyeater</h1><hr>
  <section id="mainleft">
  <p>The <strong>Yellow-faced honeyeater</strong> <em>(Caligavis chrysops)</em> is a small to medium-sized bird in the 
    <a id = "NoUnderline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeyeater" target="_blank">honeyeater</a> family, Meliphagidae. 
    It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, 
    clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, 
    in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and woodlands along creeks and rivers. 
    Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, 
    as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as Banksia and Grevillea, and soft fruits. It catches 
    insects in flight as well as gleaning them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.</p>

    <p>Some yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands migrate northwards between March and May to 
    spend the winter in southern Queensland, and return in July and August to breed in southern New South Wales and Victoria. 
    They form socially monogamous pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate cup-shaped nest. The success rate can be low, 
    and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.</p>
    
    <p>Honeyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common 
    and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be of 
    least concern for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<hr>
<section id="text">
<p>The yellow-faced honeyeater was first described, and placed in the genus Sylvia, by ornithologist John Latham in his 1801 
  work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae.<sup><small>[2]</small></sup><sup><small>[3]</small></sup> 
  French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre 
  Vieillot described it as Melithreptus gilvicapillus in 1817, and English zoologist George Robert Gray as Ptilotis 
  trivirgata in 1869.<sup><small>[4]</small></sup> The specific name chrysops is derived from the Ancient Greek words chrysos meaning 'gold' and prosopo 
  meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.</p>
  <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011.<sup><small>[5]</small></sup> 
    Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among 
    honeyeaters in the genus, using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling, confirmed previous findings that Lichenostomus 
    is not monophyletic.<sup><small>[6]</small></sup> Five species have previously been described as comprising the 
    Caligavis subgroup, but studies, 
    using the mitochondrial DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the black-throated 
    honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C. obscurus) of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped 
    into the genus Caligavis. The generic name derives from the Latin caligo 'mist, obscurity' and avis 'bird'.<sup><small>[7]</small></sup> 
    The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus) and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed 
    in a separate genus as Bolemoreus.<sup><small>[8]</small></sup> A 2017 genetic study, using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, 
    found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around 
    seven million years ago.<sup><small>[9]</small></sup></p>
    <p>There are three subspecies of the yellow-faced honeyeater, two of which were described by Gregory Mathews in 
      1912.<sup><small>[10]</small></sup><sup><small>[11]</small></sup> There are only very slight differences between the 
      nominate race and C. c. samueli found in the 
      Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia, and C. c. barroni from the Clarke Range and the Atherton Tableland in 
      Queensland. The latter race is described as "poorly differentiated" and "possibly not worthy of recognition" 
      by the Handbook of the Birds of the World. <sup><small>[12]</small></sup></p>
      <p>The Surgeon-General of New South Wales John White caught a specimen in May 1788 calling it a yellow-faced 
        flycatcher in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, which was published in 1790.<sup><small>[13]</small></sup> 
        Latham called it the black-cheeked warbler.<sup><small>[2]</small></sup> John Gould called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848,[14] which has become 
        its official name. It is also known as the yellow-gaped honeyeater, or the quitchup, in reference to its call.<sup><small>[15]</small></sup></p>

  <h2>Description</h2><hr>
  <section id="mainleft">
    <h3><strong>Appearance</strong></h3>
    <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater is a medium-small, greyish-brown bird that takes its common name from distinctive 
    yellow stripes on the sides of the head.<sup><small>[16]</small></sup> Yellow feathers form a narrow stripe above the gape, which broadens 
    and curves below the eye to end in a small white patch of feathers on the ear coverts. Above the yellow stripe is 
    a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct 
    black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked 
    with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. 
    Olive-green outer edges on the remiges combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and 
    slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The iris is a dusky blue in adult 
    birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, 
    an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being 
    slightly larger (on average, 0.8 g (0.03 oz) heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the 
    subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages 15–17.5 centimetres (5.9–6.9 in) in length, with a wingspan of 21.5–26 
    cm (8.5–10.2 in), and a weight of 12.5–20.5 grams (0.44–0.72 oz), with an average of 17 g (0.60 oz)).
    <sup><small>[12]</small></sup><sup><small>[15]</small></sup></p>
  
  <h3>Vocalizations</h3>
  <p>One of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, 
    and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before 
    dawn.<sup><small>[15]</small></sup> The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common 
    name of quitchup is derived.<sup><small>[16]</small></sup> Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. 
    The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. 
    The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note 
    calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.<sup><small>[15]</small></sup></p>

  <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2><hr>
  <section id=mainright>
    <h3><strong>Habitat</strong></h3>
    <p>Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats—in open sclerophyll forests from 
      coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in riparian woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open 
      forests dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) with ironbarks and stringybarks, such as narrow-leaved ironbark 
      (Eucalyptus crebra) and silver-leaved ironbark (E. melanophloia), with a light, shrubby understorey, and less often 
      in dry, open forests and woodlands dominated by Angophora, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina or Callitris, or in high-altitude, 
      tall, open forests of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and woodlands dominated by snow gum (E. pauciflora) 
      or white box (E. albens). It has been recorded in coastal heath when banksias are blooming, and among flowering mangroves. 
      It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and blackberries, and in developed areas 
      including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests 
      regenerating after fire or logging, though it is more common in mature forests.[17] Where it is found in woodland, 
      it is usually woodland near forest or with an understory of sclerophyll plants.[18]</p>

  <h3>Range</h3>
  <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near Cooktown in Far North 
    Queensland, and between a line from Charters Towers south to Albury and the coast, and then west to the Fleurieu 
    Peninsula and the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. Population densities have been recorded from 0.01 birds 
    per hectare (2.5 acres) near Armidale in New South Wales to 7.8 birds per hectare at Tarnagulla, Victoria. During 
    the winter months of June and July, numbers are generally lower in Victoria and higher in Queensland, following 
    their northward migration.[19]</p>
    <h3>Migration</h3>
    <p>There are resident populations of the yellow-faced honeyeater throughout its range, but it is for the most 
      part a seasonal, latitudinal, daytime migrant. During the autumn (March to May), it migrates north along the 
      highlands and coastal fringe of eastern Australia to southern Queensland, to return in the spring 
      (August to October) of the same year.[20] The birds commonly move in flocks of 10 to 100 birds, but 
      occasionally in larger groups of 1,000 or more. The groups can include other species, such as the white-naped 
      honeyeater, fuscous honeyeater, noisy friarbird, and silvereye. They move in successive flocks at a rate of up 
      to several thousand birds an hour.[21] Over 100,000 birds were recorded passing Hastings Point in New South 
      Wales over the course of a single day in May 1965.[22] The species is able to detect geomagnetic fields, and 
      uses them to navigate while migrating.[23] Experiments, where the vertical component of the magnetic field was 
      reversed, indicate that the magnetic compass of the yellow-faced honeyeater is based on the inclination of the 
      field lines and not on polarity, meaning they distinguish between the direction of the equator and the South Pole, 
      rather than north and south.[24] Their flight is in one general direction, but is not in a straight line, as the 
      flocks stay in vegetated areas, negotiate gaps in the mountain ranges, and detour around cities.[25]</p>
      <p>The migration of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, has generally been described as occurring mainly 
        in response to external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an influx of water.[26] The yellow-faced 
        honeyeater has been found to have a broad range of characteristics that are more often associated with Northern 
        Hemisphere migrants. These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based 
        on magnetic, solar and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.[27]</p>
